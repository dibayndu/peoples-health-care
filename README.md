# Getting Started with People's Health Care

This project was bootstrapped with [People's HealthCare](https://people-s-health-care.web.app).
## Description:
People's Health Care, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment, both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; and for their housing during this process. The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation and for teaching.
